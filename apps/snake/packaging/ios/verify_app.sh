#
# What it looks for:
#
#   * Info.plist is valid, names the identifier, the executable, the version, the
#     icon set and a launch screen, says it is an iPhone/iPad program, and holds
#     no usage text for a permission (the game asks for none);
#   * the compiled asset catalogue (the icon) is in the bundle;
#   * the executable is for arm64 and links nothing outside the system: Qt is
#     static on iOS, so a link to a Qt framework or to a path on the build
#     machine means the wrong kit was used;
#   * Info.plist declares that the game uses no encryption beyond the system's, and a
#     build number, as TestFlight asks;
#   * with --signed: the code signature verifies, the profile is embedded, it is an
#     ad-hoc one (it names devices and does not allow a debugger to attach) and it
#     belongs to this bundle identifier. With --store it must be an App Store one
#     instead: no devices, and no debugger.
#
# macOS only (plutil, otool, codesign, security).
