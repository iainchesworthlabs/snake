# Testing

Tests use Catch2 through CTest. Each test carries one label that names its kind: `unit`,
`integration`, `system`, `ui` or `perf`. CI runs them in that order, with `unit`,
`integration` and `system` in parallel, `ui` at two jobs, and `perf` last on its own.
A failed test is run once more by name; a pass on the second run is reported as a warning so
flaky tests stay visible. A phase that matches no tests fails, unless the phase is marked optional.

| Kind | Where | Example |
|---|---|---|
| unit | `libs/*/tests` | `test_parse.cpp` |
| integration | `apps/*/tests` | `cli.greets` runs the executable |

## Coverage

`linux-coverage` builds with instrumentation. CI runs gcovr and `coverage_gate.py` against
`tools/coverage-floors.json`. Floors are per component: `default` applies to any component not
listed. The gate prints a hint when a component is above its floor; raise the floor in the same
pull request so coverage only moves up.

A line that cannot be reached by a test, such as a failing system call, is excluded with a
`GCOVR_EXCL_BR_LINE` comment and a reason.

## Running one kind

```bash
ctest --preset linux-debug -L unit
```
